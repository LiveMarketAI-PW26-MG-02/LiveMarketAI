# Project LiveMarketAI

## Context
The project operates within environments where stability cannot be presupposed. Emphasis is placed on relations between signal emergence, internal coherence, and regulated response behavior, without commitment to specific formulations or execution pathways.

## Operating Assumptions
- Contextual parameters are not assumed to remain fixed  
- Evaluative states are subject to revision  
- System responses are not constrained to singular modes  
- Confidence metrics are treated as non-canonical

## Structure
The project follows conceptual dependency rather than procedural order. Sections may appear incomplete, redundant, or deferred by design.

## Attribution
This work is developed by Adishree Gupta, Bhumika Lokare, Bhavani S, and Akshat Choudhary, under the academic guidance of Professor Mahitha G.

## Status
